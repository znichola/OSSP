# Unnamed project 

The Orbital Expansion Program (maybe? keep changeing the name), an open source 4x style managment game with "realistic" orbital dynamics.

## The stack

Zig + raylib. Tried using raylib with C and it was a massive pain to compile. So zig is nice for it's cross compilation and easy single binary instalation.
