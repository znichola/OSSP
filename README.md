# Unnamed project 

The Orbital Expansion Program (maybe? name keep changeing), an open source managment game.

## The stack

Zig + raylib. Tried using raylib with just C and it was a massive pain to compile, can't imagine getting it to work on all the architectures, make is nice, but not portable.
